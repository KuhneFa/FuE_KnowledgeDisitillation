Task- Outline a detailed process flow for the Legal Compliance Review subprocess within an event driven procurement system, ensuring that all events and functions are described using the specified elements in passive and active voice respectively, without reusing any of the previously mentioned elements.


1. Define 'Event' by creating specific noun phrases representing instances where legal compliance is checked for each order. The phrase should be in the passive form.

2. Define 'Function' by crafting action-oriented verbs and objects that describe activities within the subprocess, presented actively.

3. Combine an 'Event' with a corresponding 'Function' to illustrate how they interact in the process flow.

4. Provide additional 'Event' instances related to legal compliance checks without reusing prior elements.

5. Supplement the 'Functions' with further activities that are typically involved in legal compliance reviews, still avoiding previous examples and maintaining active voice.
 Written Summary-

In an event-driven procurement process, the Legal Compliance Review subprocess is a critical component ensuring adherence to international laws and regulations. The function of this subprocess can be outlined as follows-

Function - Initiate_ComplianceReview(LegalOversightAgent, OrderDetails)
Event - RegulatoryEvaluationRequested(OrderID)
Event - ComplianceStatusAchieved(ProductLine, StatusCode)

By initiating a compliance review, the Legal Oversight Agent examines an order's details against pertinent regulations. When regulatory evaluation is requested for a specific order ID, it triggers the legal compliance check process. Once the product line has been assessed for compliance, a status code reflecting whether or not the standards are met is determined and recorded.

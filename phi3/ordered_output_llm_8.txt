0: StartEvent - Order placed by supplier
3: Subprocess 1 - Supplier Evaluation, Subprocess 2 - Vendor Negotiation

---

To construct a more complex scenario with added constraints-


In an advanced event-driven process chain modeling the procurement process of a multinational corporation that operates in multiple currencies and time zones, starting from 'StartEvent - Order placed by supplier', identify two branches of parallel subprocesses. Each branch must incorporate considerations for currency exchange rates fluctuations (Branch A) and compliance with international trade regulations (Branch B). Provide names adhering to the structure- ‘Subprocess %Number% - ‘. Ensure that each name does not exceed 60 symbols, includes at least one term related to the added constraints, and avoids any of the previously mentioned elements or terms.

For 'Vendor Selection', a loop could represent the iterative process of selecting vendors from different regions or evaluating multiple proposals to ensure compliance with international standards and regulations before finalizing.


For 'Payment Processing', this subprocess would handle the actual transfer of funds, but it wouldn't inherently require looping through events as described in your instruction for a start event context.
